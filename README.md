This repo is created to store algrithms I have learned and implemented.

So I will add more folders to store other algorithms later

I also implemented CI with github action

Starting from A*

1) A* find the shortest path from the start point to the goal

2) Grap Based SLAM backend, implemented Guassian-Newton and LM algorithm to solve the optimization problem
