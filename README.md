This repo is created to store algorithms I have learned and implemented.

I also implemented a simple CI with github action


1) A* find the shortest path from the start point to the goal

2) Grap Based SLAM backend, implemented Guassian-Newton and LM algorithm to solve the optimization problem

3) Kalman Filter, a C++ Kalman Filter implementation

4) Merge Sort, a simple merge sort algorithom implementation in C++
